The wait command pretty straight forward:

wait 10.
print "done waiting".

It will take 10 seconds before 'done waiting' shows up.
Using wait 0 will let the script wait for one physics tick, this can be handy for
when you're doing stuff with maneuvers. Maneuvers don't show up instantly but show up
after one physics tick. More about maneuvers in part ???.

The until command will keep looping a piece of code until the given value has been met.
Before we can talk about until loops let's first talk about time:seconds and the 'lock' command.

print time:seconds.

will print the current time in seconds. Let's say the time in seconds is 1 minute.
It would print 60. You can also set the current time as a variable:

set CurrentTime to time:seconds.

The variable CurrentTime will stay 60 seconds. Using the 'set' command will look at
a value and pick that value to be same, even if the value it was set to changes.
For instance, printing CurrentTime would give 60. Not only at time:seconds = 60,
also at any other time like time:seconds = 4000. Eventhough time:seconds is 4000,
CurrentTime is still 60.

The 'lock' command updates constantly the variable, for example:

lock TimeSecondsPlusTen to time:seconds + 10.

If you print TimeSecondsPlusTen at 60 seconds it will show 70, if you print
TimeSecondsPlusTen at 4000 seconds it will show 4010.

________________________________________________________________________________

If we now combine all the command we can make the following piece of code:

set Adder to 0.
lock Multiplier to Adder * 2.
set TimePlusFive to time:seconds + 5.

until time:seconds > TimePlusFive {
  print Multiplier.
  set Adder to Adder + 1.
  wait 1.
}

So an easy way to read the until loop is to cover what ever is inside of the curly brackets
and say: until time:seconds is bigger than our current time plus 5 seconds, print
Multiplier, increase the value of Adder and wait 1 second.

The outcome of this piece of is:
0
2
4
6
8
10

You can also use the 'wait until' command, this blocks all other code until the
conditions have been met.

set TimePlusFive to time:seconds + 5.
wait until time:seconds > TimePlusFive.
print "done waiting".
