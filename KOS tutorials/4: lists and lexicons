set Value1 to 0.
set Value2 to 5.
set Value3 to 10.
set Value4 to 15.
set Value5 to 20.

Let's say we want to put these values in a list we want to edit later we can put them into a list by typing the following:

set ValueList to list(Value1, Value2, Value3, Value4, Value5).
print ValueList.

This will show:
[0] = 0
[1] = 5
[2] = 10
[3] = 15
[4] = 20

As you can see the list goes from 0-4 instead of 1-5. So if you'd want to access Value3 you'd need to look for [2].
This can be done as follows:

print ValueList[2]. // shows 10

But let's say you want to print every item in the list you could do:

print ValueList[0]. // shows 0
print ValueList[1]. // shows 5
print ValueList[2]. // shows 10
print ValueList[3]. // shows 15
print ValueList[4]. // shows 20

But the problem with this is that you have to know how big the list is and it'd take up a lot space when dealing with big lists.

for Whatever in ValueList {
  print Whatever.
}

for Value in ValueList {
  print Value.
}

Both pieces of code do EXACTLY the same.
This checks each item in a given list (now called Whatever) and does what the curly brackets contains. 
In this case it prints:
0
5
10
15
20

Lexicons are in a way the same as lists but they have some crucial differences.
Lexicons can store a pair of information, for example:

set MyLexicon to lexicon("MyValue1", 100, "MyValue2", 200, "MyValue3", 300).

The following piece of code acts EXACTLY the same as the piece of code above but is easier to read:

set MyLexicon to lexicon(
  "MyValue1", 100,
  "MyValue2", 200,
  "MyValue3", 300
).

print MyLexicon["MyValue1"]. // shows 100
print MyLexicon["MyValue2"]. // shows 200
print MyLexicon["MyValue3"]. // shows 300
